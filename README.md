As a professional real estate investor, financial modelling is my bread and butter. It is the primary tool I use to make investment decisions. It is also something I love to play around with in my free time.

This repo collects some of the financial models I built in the past. Mostly for fun. Some of them will be based on projects I have been involved in, others on courses I've taken and still others simply on projects I am fascinated by.

**Disclaimer**: The information used in these projects are based primarily on publicly available data, supplemented with 'reasonable assumptions' on my part. It is therefore inherently limited and should not be seen as official data.

Each project will have its own folder with a case description, a financial model and my personal solution and conclusions for the case. Where possible I will try to include the sources I have used to substantiate my assumptions.

Currently I have uploaded only one project yet. I will soon add others once I have cleaned them up a bit.

**Current projects**
- *100 Bishopsgate*: Major office development in central London.

PS: This repo is mainly focussed on traditional financial modelling in Excel. If, like me, you are fascinated by the potential for data science and machine learning in real estate investing, make sure to also check out [my other repo](https://github.com/mdcnuydt/data-science).
