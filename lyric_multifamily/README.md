# Intro

Your firm has been asked to fund the acquisition of The Lyric, a leading multifamily property in
Seattle, Washington. The sponsor, Amadeus Capital Partners, plans to make light capital
improvements to the property and boost its below-market rents up to market rates over five
years.
The Lyric has 234 units, including a mix of studios, 1-bedrooms, and 2-bedrooms, with an
average size of 796 square feet, as well as 360 parking spots. Amenities include a rooftop deck,
sky lounge, high-tech theater, fitness center, private balconies and patios, and front-load
washers and dryers in each unit.
The sponsor plans to acquire the property for approximately $104 million USD (Cap Rate of
4.50%), spend approximately $800,000 on capital improvements, boost the property’s revenue
growth and margins, and sell it within 3-5 years.
The sponsor believes that prevailing Cap Rates in Seattle are dangerously low (the median rate
is currently under 4.50%), so it plans to use a higher-than-normal LTV of 85% to do the deal.

Rather than a traditional Senior Loan and Mezzanine structure, the sponsor plans to use a
Senior Loan (65% LTV), Mezzanine (10% LTV), and Preferred Equity (10% LTV), each with
different terms.
By doing so, the sponsor believes that it can earn an IRR of 20% or greater, significantly above
the typical 8-10% IRR targeted in core and core-plus deals.
Amadeus has asked your firm to participate by investing in the Senior Loan, Mezzanine, or
Preferred Equity.
Your job in this case study is to determine which, if any, of these tranches your firm should
invest in, and to analyze the key risk factors and explain how you might mitigate them.
Your firm is skeptical of this deal because it believes that the Seattle multifamily market is
overheated and set to decline within the next 2-3 years. However, with the right terms, a credit
investment could still pay off.
To complete this analysis and make a decision, you will create multiple operational scenarios,
including Base, Downside, and Extreme Downside cases, calculate the returns to all the investor
groups, and complete a simple valuation of the property.
The Base Case will represent continued, moderate rental and expense growth with no
downturns or recessions. The Downside Case will reflect a moderate recession over Years 2-3,
followed by a recovery, and the Extreme Downside Case will reflect a major recession over
Years 2-3, followed by a recovery.
Please use the following assumptions to complete the provided Excel template. You have three
(3) hours to make the calculations and respond to the case study questions:
Part 1 – Acquisition, Financing, and Exit Assumptions
Use the following figures to set up the key model assumptions:

- Acquisition Date: 2018-12-31
- Going-In Cap Rate: 4.50%
- Acquisition Costs: 1.0% of Acquisition Price
- CapEx and Replacement Reserves: $500,000

Use the following numbers for the Senior Loan, Mezzanine, and Preferred Equity:

| Term                      | Senior Loan                 | Mezzanine     | Preferred Equity |
| ---                       | ---                         | ---           | ---              |
| Loan-to-Value (LTV)       | 65.0%                       | 10.0%         | 10.0%            |
| Cash Interest Rate        | L+2.0%; LIBOR Floor of 2.0% | 4.0%          | N/A              |
| PIK Interest Rate         | N/A                         | 4.0%          | 10.0%            |
| Issuance Fees             | 1.0%                        | 1.0%          | 1.0%             |
| Interest-Only Period      | 2 yrs                       | Entire Period | Entire Period    |
| Amortization Period       | 30 yrs                      | N/A           | N/A              |
| Maturity                  | 10 yrs                      | 5 yrs         | 5 yrs            |
| Prepayment Penalty        | 1.5%                        | 1.5%          | 1.5%             |
| Equity Percentage On Exit | N/A                         | N/A           | 5.0%             |

Assume that LIBOR rises from 1.90% in FY 19 to 2.40% in FY 23.
Your firm is seeking a minimum Debt Yield of 6.0%, Cash Interest Coverage Ratio of 1.50x, and
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of 1.20x.
The property may be sold at the end of FY 21, FY 22, or FY 23. Assume Selling Costs of 2.0% and
the following trends for Cap Rates:

| Scenario         | FY19  | FY20  | FY21  | FY22  | FY23  |
| ---              | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---   |
| Base             | 4.55% | 4.60% | 4.65% | 4.70% | 4.75% |
| Downside         | 4.55% | 6.00% | 5.50% | 5.00% | 5.00% |
| Extreme Downside | 4.55% | 6.50% | 6.00% | 5.50% | 5.25% |

These Cap Rates represent continued growth but an increasingly older building in the Base
Case, a moderate recession and recovery in the Downside Case, and a major recession and
recovery in the Extreme Downside Case.
Cap Rates for similar multifamily properties in Seattle have ranged between 4.5% and 5.5% over
the past ~7 years; the peak Cap Rate in the 2009 recession was 5.8%, and the peak rate in the
2001 recession was 7.3%.

# Operating Assumptions

The property’s operational performance depends on overall market trends as well as the rent
increases the sponsor is attempting to enact.
Use the following assumptions for each line item:

- Market Rent per Unit per Month: $2,500 in FY 18
- In-Place Rent per Unit per Month: $2,300 in FY 18
- In-Place Rent Discount to Market Rent: 7.5% in FY 19 falling to 1.0% by FY 22
- Parking Fees per Spot per Month: $150 in FY 18
- Utility Reimbursements % Utility Expense: 85.0% in FY 18 rising to 90% by FY 23
- Insurance per Gross Square Foot per Year: $0.55 in FY 18
- Utilities per Unit per Month: $130.00 in FY 18
- Replacement Reserves per Unit per Year: $400.00 in FY 18
- Sales, Marketing & Administrative % EGI: 10.0% in FY 18 rising to 10.5% by FY 23
- % Apartment Unit Turnover: 10.0% in FY 18 rising to 20.0% by FY 23
- Tenant Improvements per Unit Leased: $800.00 in FY 18

For the growth rates and figures that change in different scenarios, please use the assumptions
that have already been input into Excel.
These assumptions reflect a moderate 2-year recession in the Downside Case and a major 2year recession in the Extreme Downside Case. The justification for each one is as follows:

- Income Growth Rate: Historically, rent has increased between 3% and 5% per year even
in slow periods. In the last two recessions, rent declined by 3-5% before recovering.

- General Vacancy: The average vacancy rate for peer multifamily properties is 4%, and
the maximum vacancy rate historically was 7-8% in the 2001 and 2009 recessions. Over
the past five years, the average market vacancy rate has been 4-5%.

- Bad Debt & Concessions % In-Place Rent: The average percentage of peer properties is
2%; this one moves in-line with the vacancy rate during recessions because landlords
must offer more incentives to win tenants.

- Expense Growth Rate: This one follows the approximate trends in income growth, but
the percentages are lower – in recessions, operating expenses tend to decline due to
lower property usage, and in healthy markets, the opposite happens.

- Tenant Improvement (TI) Growth Rate: This one increases substantially in downturns
because landlords must offer more incentives to attract tenants; the peak in the last
recession was approximately $1,000 – $1,050 per unit. TIs decline in growth markets
because landlords gain more bargaining power over tenants.

- Leasing Commissions (LC) Growth Rate: This one also increases substantially in
downturns because landlords must pay more to incentivize brokers. The peak
percentage in the last recession was 10%, and LCs are typically 3% of effective rent in
normal market conditions.

Finally, assume Capital Expenditures (CapEx) of $1,000 per unit, $1,500 per unit, $750 per unit,
and $200 per unit in Years 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively. The sponsor is budgeting for modest
improvements, but not a full renovation.
These improvements will ensure that the Average In-Place Rent moves closer to the Average
Market Rent over a 5-year period.

# Property Pro-Forma

Complete the Pro-Forma, which has some of the expenses filled in, down to Adjusted NOI. Note
the following points as you complete this exercise:

- Loss to Lease represents the difference between In-Place and Market Rents.

- Property Taxes should be based on a small percentage of the property’s value, but to
simplify the calculation, you can grow the historical taxes at the expense growth rate.

- In-Place and Effective Rent act as drivers for different line items, so be careful of the
links.

- Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions should be linked to the annual
apartment unit turnover percentage.

# Debt Service and Credit Stats and Ratios

You will NOT be able to use the IPMT and PPMT functions in this model because of the Senior
Loan’s Interest-Only Period and floating Interest Rate, so you’ll have to calculate interest and
principal repayment manually based on straight-line amortization.
Make sure you account for Cash vs. PIK Interest, and always use the beginning balances to
calculate interest so that you avoid circular references.
When you’re done, calculate the Debt Yield, Cash Interest Coverage Ratio, and Debt Service
Coverage Ratio each year based on both NOI and Adjusted NOI.

# Returns to Equity Investors and Lenders

Start by calculating the returns to equity investors, including the cash-on-cash multiple and IRR,
and include support for variable exit years.
You must also account for the possibility of the lenders NOT receiving back the full principal
they are owed upon exit.
For example, if the Total Exit Proceeds are $100, the Senior Loan principal is $90, the Mezzanine
principal is $20, and the Preferred Equity principal is $20, the Senior Lenders will receive back
everything, the Mezzanine investors will receive back 50%, and the Preferred investors will
receive nothing.
Senior lenders rank highest, so they have the first claim to the property’s cash flows. Make sure
you apply this logic to the prepayment penalties and equity granted to Preferred investors.
Next, calculate the returns to each group of lenders, including the issuance fees and
prepayment penalties, principal repayment, cash interest, and equity granted (if applicable).
You should also calculate the Recovery percentages for the lenders based on total principal
repayments vs. the amount owed upon exit.
The Recovery will almost always be 100% for the Senior lenders, but it might be significantly
lower for the other groups, especially in the Extreme Downside case.

# Sensitivities

Create sensitivity tables at the bottom based on the three potential Exit Dates, three market
scenarios, and the IRR and Recovery for each lender group. For the Equity Investors, just create
a table for the IRR.

Below that area, create tables for the Market Scenario vs. Year 5 Exit Cap Rate and calculate the
Recovery and IRR for the same groups.
Use your judgment to pick the appropriate range for the Exit Cap Rates. Remember that as a
lender, your job is to analyze the WORST-CASE possible outcome.

# Valuation and DCF Analysis

Create a simple DCF analysis for the property, and assume a Cost of Equity of 15% to calculate
the Discount Rate. For the Terminal Cap Rate, assume that the Year 5 Exit Cap Rate in the
selected scenario increases by 0.50% by the last projected year of the DCF.
For the NOI Growth Rate and Adjusted NOI as a % of NOI, pick reasonable, simple percentages
that make sense across all three scenarios.
Create a sensitivity based on the Discount Rate and Terminal Cap Rate below the analysis. Use
your judgment, the data in this document, and the deal assumptions to pick the ranges.
Finally, review the Comparable Property Sales (“Comp-Sales”), the Rent Comps (“Apt-Comps”),
and the Replacement Cost Analysis (“Replacement-Cost”) to get a sense of the property’s
appropriate value.
You do not need to make any calculations; instead, use this data to determine whether or not
the purchase price and operating assumptions are reasonable.
